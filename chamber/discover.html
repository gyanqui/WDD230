According to available data, the population of Cusco has been steadily increasing, with recorded figures of approximately 480,000 residents in 2021, around 489,000 residents in 2022, and an estimated population of 497,000 residents in 2023.

                This steady population growth showcases Cusco's attractiveness as a place to live, work, and visit.

            <p class="pDiscover">
                While these figures demonstrate a positive trend in population growth, it is important to note that growth rates can fluctuate over time. Therefore, to obtain the most accurate and up-to-date information, it is advisable to consult official sources or recent studies on Cusco's population dynamics. Nonetheless, Cusco's consistent growth suggests a thriving city that continues to attract individuals from various backgrounds, contributing to its cultural richness and ongoing development.

                    Moray (Quechua: Muray) is an archaeological site in Peru approximately 50 kilometres (31 mi) northwest of Cuzco on a high plateau at about 3,500 metres (11,500 ft) and just west of the village of Maras. The site contains Inca ruins, mostly consisting of several terraced circular depressions, the largest of which is approximately 30 m (98 ft) deep. As with many other Inca sites, it also has an irrigation system.

                <p class="pDiscover">
                    The purpose of these depressions is uncertain, but their depth, design, and orientation with respect to wind and sun creates a temperature difference of as much as 5 °C (9 °F) between the top and the bottom.

                    Sacsayhuamán, often spelled Saqsaywaman or Xacxaguaman, (possibly from Quechua language, waman falcon or variable hawk), is a citadel on the northern outskirts of the city of Cusco, Peru, the historic capital of the Inca Empire. The site is at an altitude of 3,701 m (12,142 ft).

                <p class="pDiscover">
                    The complex was built by the Incas in the 15th century, particularly under Sapa Inca Pachacuti and his successors. Dry stone walls constructed of huge stones were built on the site, with the workers carefully cutting the boulders to fit them together tightly without mortar.

                <p class="pDiscover">
                    In 1983, Cusco and Sacsayhuamán together were designated as sites on the UNESCO World Heritage List, for international recognition and protection. The site is now constantly explored by tourists

                    Vinicunca, or Winikunka, also called Montaña de Siete Colores (literally: Mountain of seven colors), Montaña de Colores (Mountain of colors) or Montaña Arcoíris (Rainbow Mountain), is a mountain in the Andes of Peru with an altitude of 5,200 metres (17,100 ft) above sea level. It is located on the road to the Ausangate mountain, in the Cusco region, between Cusipata District, province of Quispicanchi, and Pitumarca District, province of Canchis.
                </p>
                <p class="pDiscover">
                    Tourist access requires a two-hour drive from Cusco and a walk of about 5 kilometers (3.1 mi), or a three-and-a-half-hour drive through Pitumarca and a one-half-kilometre (0.31 mi) steep walk (1–1.5 hours) to the hill. As of 2019, no robust methods of transportation to Vinicunca have been developed to accommodate travelers, as it requires passage through a valley.

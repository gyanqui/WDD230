            <p>
                Hick's Law states that the more options you present to a user, the longer it will take them to make
                a decision. Airbnb exemplifies this principle by limiting the number of choices on their homepage. 
                They present users with a simple search bar, a list of recent searches, and a few suggested destinations. 
                This reduces decision fatigue and makes it easier for users to start searching for a place to stay.

            <h3>Fitt's Law</h3>
            <h4>Amazon</h4>
            <a href="https://www.amazon.com/">amazon.com</a>

            <p>
                Fitt's Law is a principle that explains the correlation between the size of a target, its distance from
                the user, and the time required to reach and select it. It has been widely employed in user
                interface design, such as in the Amazon search bar, Amazon has prioritized the
                search bar's size and position, creating a simple and effective UX that allows customers to quickly search for and purchase products.

            <h3>White Space/Clean Design</h3>
            <h4>Apple</h4>
            <a href="https://www.apple.com/">apple.com</a>
            <img src="images/apple_1.avif" alt="Apple page image">

            <p>
                White Space and Clean Design refers to the use of negative space to create a clear and uncluttered design.
                Apple exemplifies this principle by using plenty of white space on their homepage. The design is minimalist,
                with few distractions and a clear hierarchy of information. The use of white space makes it easier for users
                to focus on the most important information on the page.
